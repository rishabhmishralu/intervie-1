<h1>JS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</h1>
<h2>DAY1</h2>
<hr>
<p><b>1-Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</b></p>
<p>both are used for comparing two variable and given bollean values .==is used for check two values and called as loose eqality and ===comaring the values and as well as data type and known as sticlly opretor </p>

<hr>
<p><b>2-What is the spread operator?</b></p>
<p>spread operator are introduce in ES6 . and use for deconstruting for non premative data types .</p>
<pre>const a=[2,3,4,5,6]
    const b=["risahbh",...a]
    console.log(b)</pre>
    <p>rest oprator</p>
    <pre>const a=["ram",'yash',2,3,4,5,6]
        const b=[x,y,...rest]=a
        let sum=0;
        for ( let i in rest )
        sum+=rest[i]
        console.log(sum);
        
        
        function sum(x,...rest){
            let sum=0;
        for ( let i in rest )
        sum+=rest[i]
        console.log(sum);
        }
        sum(2,3,4)</pre>
<hr>
<p><b>3-What are the differences between var, let and const?</b></p>
<p>var = var is global scope .and  it can be declared without initialization.hoisting done, with initializing as ‘ default ’ <br>
let &const variable both are block scope.and itroduce in ES6.
Hoisting is done , but not initialized (this is the reason for the error when we access the let/const variable before declaration/initializatio <br>
nad one difference between let and const in let case It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.but in case of const It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope. </p>
<hr>
<p><b>4-What is execution context</b></p>
<p>The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution. <br> and There are two types of execution contexts: global and function. The global execution context is created when a JavaScript script first starts to run, and it represents the global scope in JavaScript. A function execution context is created whenever a function is called, representing the function's local scope. </p>
<hr>
<p><b>5-What is meant by first class functions</b></p>
<p>first class function that can be passed an argument to another function and can be return an a function and  assign as a value to a varaibles</p>
<hr>
<p><b>6-What are closures? Give an example of closure</b></p>
<p>Function along with a lexicule scope together a bundlle  forms a closure.</p>
<pre>function x(){
    var a=10;
    function y(b){
       console.log( a+b); 

    }
    y(5)
}
x()</pre>
<hr>
<p><b>7-Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</b></p>
<p>call( ) :The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method.

    It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).
</p><pre>const student={
    name:"rishbah",
    lastname:"mishra",
    std:10
}


const student2={
    name:"aryan",
    lastname:"pal",
    std:11
}

function getname(){
    console.log(this.name);
}
getname.call(student)

</pre>

<pre>const student={
    name:"rishbah",
    lastname:"mishra",
    std:10,

   printfullname:function(){
    console.log(this.name);
   }
    
}
student.printfullname()


const student2={
    name:"aryan",
    lastname:"pal",

}</pre>
<pre>let  printfullname=function(){
    console.log(this.name);
   }
    
const student={
    name:"rishbah",
    lastname:"mishra",
    std:10
}
printfullname.call(student)


const student2={
    name:"aryan",
    lastname:"pal",

}
printfullname.call(student2)</pre>
<p>Apply is very similar to the call function. The only difference is that in apply you can pass an array as an argument list.</p> 
<pre>const student={
    name:"rishbah",
    lastname:"mishra",
    std:10
}


const student2={
    name:"aryan",
    lastname:"pal",
    std:11
}

function getname(n){
    console.log(this.name+" "+n);
}
getname.call(student,["delhi,lucknow"])
</pre>
<p>bind():
    bind method is same as call method only differnce in bind method  bind the method and object and copy of the method  which can be called letter.</p>
<pre>function student(e){
    console.log(this.name,e);
}

let student1={
    name:"rishabh",
    age:12
}

let copy=student.bind(student1,"rishabh mishra")
copy()</pre>
